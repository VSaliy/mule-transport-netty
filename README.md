Prerequisites
===============================
* Mule 3.2.0-SNAPSHOT (depends on changes in Mule concurrent libs, like dropping backport-util-concurrent)
* Netty development builds (e.g. 4.0.0.Alpha1-SNAPSHOT). Best built directly from source by forking it here on GitHub: http://github.com/netty/netty
* Java 6 - a dependency of Netty 4.x library and Mule 3.2.x in the future
